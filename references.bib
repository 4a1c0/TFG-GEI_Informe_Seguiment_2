	abstract = {With the development of machine learning algorithms, convolutional neural network (CNN) has become one of the most popular algorithm in recent years. It requires a large number of convolution operations and nonlinear activation function operations. The traditional method of implementation of CNN was employed by a Centre Process Unit(CPU) or a Graphic Process Unit(GPU), however in order to pursue faster computing speed, an acceleration architecture based on hardware computing was expected. A System on chip(SoC) is used for accelerating CNN, controlled by a RISC-V processor is proposed on FPGA in this paper. The convolutional array and activation function arrays accelerate the standard floating-point multiply-accumulate calculations and activation functions, respectively. Which can be used to accelerate the CNN process greatly.},
